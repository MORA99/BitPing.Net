                    To get the full benefit of BPN you need to implement the HTTP POST api callback.<br><br>
                    We provide a simple example in PHP to receive the events below, please note that the secret value is unique to your account, and should be kept secret.<br>
                    If you build a module for a webshop, the secret value should be user editable.
                    <br><br>
                    When you choose to receive HTTP POST events for a order, we will contact your webserver when a payment has received the required amount of confirmations.<br>
                    The HTTP POST event will contain the following variables<br><br>

                    <table>
                        <tr><td>TEST</td><td>Included in test reports, you should check that this is not set when done testing<br>However people still need your secret to make a valid test.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>to_address</td><td>The receiver address monitored<br>If there are more than one monitored address in an transaction, a seperate call will be made for each</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>amount</td><td>Amount in satoshi (100 million satoshi make a bitcoin)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>btc_amount</td><td>Amount in BTC (. as decimal seperator)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>confirmations</td><td>The number of current confirmations.<br>Note that this may be higher than requested.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>txhash</td><td>The hash of the transaction that included the address</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>block</td><td>The block that included the transaction</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>signature</td><td>A signature generated using your secret key<br>You should validate this to make sure its not a fraud attempt.</td></tr>
                    </table>
